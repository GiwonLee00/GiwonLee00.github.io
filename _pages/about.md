Hello! I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in VILAB led by Prof. Kuk-Jin Yoon in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST. I work on `Motion Planning` and `End-to-End Autonomous Driving`. I aim to integrate planning and policy learning while enabling fast adaptation to diverse roads, weather, and traffic. `Safety` and `Generalization` are my core goals, and I benchmark methods rigorously in simulation and with real-world data.

I enjoy open discussions on research and practice, and I am always open to exchanging ideas on `Motion Planning` and `End-to-End Autonomous Driving`. Please feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:dlrldnjs@kaist.ac.kr) or on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/giwon-lee-515911336).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
