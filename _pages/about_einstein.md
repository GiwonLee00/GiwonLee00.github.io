Hello! I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in VILAB led by Prof. Kuk-Jin Yoon in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST. I work on `Motion Planning` and `End-to-End Autonomous Driving`. I aim to integrate planning and policy learning while enabling fast adaptation to diverse roads, weather, and traffic. `Safety` and `Generalization` are my core goals, and I benchmark methods rigorously in simulation and with real-world data.

I enjoy open discussions on research and practice, and I am always open to exchanging ideas on `Motion Planning` and `End-to-End Autonomous Driving`. Please feel free to get in touch by [email](mailto:dlrldnjs@kaist.ac.kr) or on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/giwon-lee-515911336).
